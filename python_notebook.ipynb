If applicable, DEATHTIME provides the time of in-hospital death for the patient. Note that DEATHTIME is only present if the patient died in-hospital, and is almost always the same as the patient’s DISCHTIME. However, there can be some discrepancies due to typographical errors.\n",

Newborn indicates that the HADM_ID pertains to the patient’s birth.\n",

The values occasionally change between hospital admissions (HADM_ID) for a single patient (SUBJECT_ID).

The diagnosis is usually assigned by the admitting clinician and does not use a systematic ontology. As of MIMIC-III v1.0 there were 15,693 distinct diagnoses for 58,976 admissions. The diagnoses can be very informative (e.g. chronic kidney failure) or quite vague (e.g. weakness). Final diagnoses for a patient’s hospital stay are coded on discharge and can be found in the DIAGNOSES_ICD table.

Standardizing the One-Hot encoded features would mean assigning a distribution to categorical features. You don’t want to do that! While it is fine to apply normalization to all kinds of columns including One-Hot Encorded features because One-Hot encoded features are already in the range between 0 to 1. So, normalization would not affect their value."
